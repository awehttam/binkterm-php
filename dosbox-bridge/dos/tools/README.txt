DOS Utilities Directory
=======================

This directory is mounted as C:\TOOLS in DOSBox and is included in the PATH.

Place DOS utilities and tools here that should be accessible from all door games.

Common utilities you might add:
- FOSSIL drivers (X00.SYS, BNU.COM, etc.)
- File compression tools (PKZIP, ARJ, etc.)
- Text editors
- Network utilities
- Debug tools

The tools directory is automatically added to the PATH in autoexec, so any
executables placed here will be available from any directory.
