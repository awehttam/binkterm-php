This archieve should contain ANSIPAT.EXE and this doc file ANSIPAT.DOC

The purpose of ANSIPAT.EXE is to patch your ANSI.SYS so that it will do a
BIOS call instead of a direct screen write, making it more compatible with
DOORWAY, when DOORWAY is operating in BIOS (non-direct screen) mode.
Although the /L: will work properly about 95% of the time, this patch, if it
installs, will work 100% of the time.  You will need to run this program in
the subdirectory that your ANSI.SYS, which get loaded at boot time, resides
in.  It will copy ANSI.SYS over to ANSI.BAK then search the ANSI.SYS for the
code which typically scrolls the screen.  If it finds it, it will replace it
with the appropriate screen scroll BIOS call.  If it doesn't find the
appropriate code, it will not change ANSI.SYS.  Note that you will have to
reboot the computer for the new ANSI.SYS to take effect.

However, I highly recommend using PC Magazines ANSI.COM in SLOW mode instead.
It works perfectly with DOORWAY, and can be switched to FAST mode at will,
for screen updates which are much faster than using ANSI.SYS.  It is
available from Data World BBS as ANSI_12.ZIP.
