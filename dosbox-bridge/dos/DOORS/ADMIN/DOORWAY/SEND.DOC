                             SEND.EXE

SEND.EXE is a small program which will allow you to send text out the modem
easily.  Syntax:  SEND FILENAME [/NS]

This will send the file to the screen like a type command, and if the /NS
is left off will stop every 24 lines and as if they want: MORE, NS, or NO.

You can easily send things out the modem by doing a:

      DOORWAY ...... /P:SEND FILENAME

One nice use is in the MENU; set up a menu file like this:

Welcome to the financial door.  This door will compute the balance,
payments, balloon payment, number of payments left, principle, interest
and so forth on any loan, savings or mortgage.  It is full screen
edited.  The selections may be made by using the cursor keys in doorway
mode of your com package, or by entering the letters at the beginning
of each selection.  enter an "=" to compute an entry.  You must have
