                                       PREFACE

               DOORWAY is  a software program  which allows remote control  of a
               computer via a  modem.  It also  allows almost any program  to be
               run as a  door for bulletin  board systems.  Bulletin  boards can
               utilize DOORWAY to  transform normal  programs  into "DOORS", and
               anyone can use DOORWAY as a remote utility.  As a remote utility,
               DOORWAY will allow  you to control a distant  computer via modem,
               as if you  were there.  DOORWAY will redirect all programs on the
               host  computer,  with   the  exception  of  programs   which  use
               bit-mapped graphics.

               DOORWAY shells to the program to run, or shells COMMAND.COM, when
               used as a remote utility.   DOORWAY then translates and redirects
               all video to the required COM port and all COM port inputs to the
               keyboard buffer.  BIOS interrupts  or screen RAM comparisons  are
               used, so that programs, which DOS CTTY cannot redirect, can still
               be  used. The  HOST's keyboard  is active  so that the  SYSOP (or
               person on  the HOST  end) can aid  a REMOTE  user, and  the SYSOP
               (bulletin board SYStem OPerator) can monitor what the REMOTE user
               is   doing.    COMMAND.COM  is  not   loaded  by  DOORWAY  unless
               specifically instructed to do so  by the HOST setup; therefore, a
               user cannot break a program and get to DOS. If  the user exits or
               breaks the program, he will  simply return to DOORWAY, which will
               return  to the bulletin  board (or HOST  program) after resetting
               all  vectors,  including  any the  application  program  may have
               changed.

               Doorway monitors Carrier  Detect, and after displaying  a message
               that carrier was lost, returns to the bulletin board or HOST.  It
               monitors  the input character  string and traps  any character(s)
               the SYSOP wants trapped  (such as ^C).  DOORWAY can  also abort a
               program with any character(s) the  SYSOP has defined, thus making
               it possible to run UNBREAKABLE programs, such  as many commercial
               games (check with  the game  publisher to verify  this is not  in
               violation of their copyright).

               The keyboard  time and user's  time are monitored, and  if either
               expires, DOORWAY  will return to  the board (or HOST).   Keyboard
               expiration time  is  settable, but  defaults  to 255  seconds  (4
               minutes 15  seconds).  See section  3 for more information.   The
               keyboard timeout is reset  on both the com port and  the bulletin
               board's keyboard, so characters entered at either  will reset the
               timer.  It can  also be reset  by video  updates.  If  you set up
               DOORWAY to  use PCBOARD.SYS  or DOOR.SYS, the  user time  will be
               computed  from what  time he  has  left, unless  overridden by  a
               command line switch.

               Full ANSI  GRAPHICS are  supported, but if  your program  doesn't
               need it, DOORWAY will  work just fine in NON-ANSI  mode.  DOORWAY
               also allows  the REMOTE  user to send  all the  extended keyboard
               codes, such as the cursor, ALT and FUNCTION keys.

                   1.   QUICK START

                     A.      A Quick DROP to DOS Implementation

                        For  the  easiest  quick   start  run  the  INSTALL
                        program. It will set  up the HOST for remote access
                        automatically.  Once  you run  this program  simply
                        type HOST  to  bring up  the host  program via  the
                        HOST.BAT file.

                        If  you are  using  a  bulletin  board  program  or
                        another host program then set up your  HOST to call
                        a  batch  file.    The  HOST  can  be  almost   any
                        communications  program set up  in HOST mode,  or a
                        full blown BBS  program set up for  remote (see its
                        documentation  on how to  implement host  or remote
                        mode).   Use the following line for  the batch file
                        it calls:

                     DOORWAY COM1 /S:* /G:ON /V:B^U /M:1000 /B:MSZ /C:DOS

                        This line tells DOORWAY to redirect to COM1, not to
                        look  for any user  specific files (/S:*),  turn on
                        graphics  (and cursor  control)  (/G:ON), use  BIOS
                        redirection  but allow  remote  user to  switch  to
                        DIRECT  SCREEN mode with  a control "U",  allow the
                        user 1000  minutes in  DOS (/M:1000),  and to  load
                        COMMAND.COM and shell to DOS (/C:DOS).

                        The /B:MSZ deals with the bottom line, and for best
                        results, one or more of the letters after the colon
                        may be  left out. Results will depend on the remote
                        communication package, and whether it is set up for
                        24 line (with a status line) mode, or 25 line mode.
                        See   the  section  on  the  /B:  switch  for  more
                        information.   Remove this  switch entirely if  you
                        are calling in with the included DWCOMM.

                     B.      A Quick DOORS Implementation

                        A quick start on a DOOR for a bulletin board system
                        can  be a  little  more complicated.    One of  the
                        following may be used to implement a DOOR:

                        i    For  PCBOARD or  a system  which generates  the
                             PCBOARD.SYS  file  and  does  NOT  use   direct
                             screen  writes  (does  not  write  directly  to
                             screen RAM):

                               DOORWAY COM1 /S:C:\PCB /B:MZ /P:PROGRAM.EXT



                                          1             DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                        ii   For same  as above but  DOES use  direct screen
                             writes:

                           DOORWAY COM1 /S:C:\PCB /B:MZ /V:D /P:PROGRAM.EXT

                        iii  For a system which  generates DOOR.SYS file and
                             does NOT use direct screen writes:

                               DOORWAY SYS /B:MZ /P:PROGRAM.EXT

                        iv.  For  a system  which generates  a DOOR.SYS file
                             and uses  direct screen writes:

                                DOORWAY SYS /B:MZ /V:D /P:PROGRAM.EXT


                        See section 3 for details on batch file 'switches'.

                   The PROGRAM.EXT is the  name of the program to put  in a
                   "DOOR". The extension  MUST be given, and any parameters
                   to  be passed  to it  must follow  the  filename on  the
                   command  line.    If  the  program  is  in  a  different
                   subdirectory  than the presently  logged drive, then the
                   program should  be preceded by  the path to the  program
                   to be  executed.  Also if  the program is going  to look
                   in its  own subdirectory for any  of its files, you  may
                   need  to put a /CD on the command  line to  tell DOORWAY
                   to log into  the program's subdirectory before  shelling
                   it. DO NOT FOLLOW THE /CD WITH A PATH,  the path will be
                   obtained from the /P: switch.

                   If  the  program  requires  cursor  positioning,  and/or
                   colors for proper operation a "/G:ON"  needs to be added
                   in front  of the /P: switch  to force graphics  on if in
                   BIOS mode.

                   If  line  feeds are  being  missed  in BIOS  mode,  then
                   either  add  a   /L:,  use  ANSI.COM  from  PC  MAGAZINE
                   utilities, or  use ANSIPAT.EXE on your  ANSI.SYS.  DOS 5
                   ANSI.SYS does not require any of these measures.

                   2.   FILES

                        Upon  initialization,  DOORWAY  looks  for  several
                        files:   The  INITIAL   WELCOME,   the  APPLICATION
                        PROGRAM,  the EXIT MESSAGE or  a TRANSLATION TABLE.
                        The  INITIAL WELCOME  and EXIT  MESSAGE  are simply
                        ASCII  (or  ANSI)  files, and  the  PROGRAM  can be
                        either a .COM  or .EXE program (for a  .BAT program
                        the  /C:VIA switch must be added).  The TRANSLATION
                        TABLE  is  generated  by  the  XTABLE.EXE   program
                        provided with DOORWAY. See  the XTABLE.DOC file for

                                          2             DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                        more information.  If the  INITIAL WELCOME or  EXIT
                        message   has  ANSI  codes  in  it,  they  will  be
                        displayed properly on the HOST and REMOTE ends.

                     A.      The INITIAL WELCOME File

                        This  ASCII or ANSI  file informs  the user  of the
                        PROGRAM  about  to   be  executed  and  any   setup
                        requirements;  such as set  NUMLOC key  and/or have
                        ANSI  graphics installed.  If any  line  is started
                        with a $:, then that  line will be printed (without
                        the "$:")  and a "Y",  "N" or [CR]  must be entered
                        before the output  will continue.  This  allows the
                        screen display to  be paused with a  statement such
                        as:

                             $:ENTER CARRIAGE RETURN TO CONTINUE; N TO QUIT

                        NOTE: The $:  must be preceded by  a CRLF sequence.
                        ANSI  editors   generally  do  not  use   the  CRLF
                        sequence.  If necessary use an ASCII  editor to add
                        the CR/LF sequence  to your ansi screen  prior this
                        code.

                        If the user enters a [RETURN] or [Y] to the prompt,
                        DOORWAY will   run the application program;  but if
                        (s)he enters an  [N],   DOORWAY will  return to the
                        Bulletin Board or HOST.

                        The initial welcome can be  made into a menu.  This
                        is  similar to the monitor function seen on RBBS's.
                        When DOORWAY is  executed, a menu can  be displayed
                        for  selection of  action to  be taken;  ie.  Run a
                        program, DROP  TO  DOS, etc.    The user  enters  a
                        number from 0 to 9 or character from A to Z and the
                        program  selected is loaded and run.  When aborted,
                        DOORWAY returns to the menu, to let the user select
                        another door if  desired.   To exit  the menu,  the
                        user enters either a number or letter  which is not
                        defined (such as a [Q]).  An @NAME@ and @TIME@ will
                        substitute the user name and time (Capital letters,
                        must be used.

                   Example:

                        The batch file:

                             doorway com1 /r:^k /g:on /i:menu

                        The following  page shows  the actual  text of  the
                        welcome file with the filename of "MENU".


                                          3             DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                        The WELCOME FILE (MENU):

                        Welcome  to Data World  BBS's games doors.   Select
                        from one of the following doors.  When through, you
                        will return  to  this  menu.   To  end  this  doors
                        session, type either 'E', 'Q' or selection 6.

                        1.   Eatumup.  A  color  graphic monster  maze  game
                             (you need ANSI).
                        2.   4inarow.  Like  Orthello.  Can  you  beat   the
                             computer (ANSI).
                        3.   Big  Rig.  Drive a  truck  across  the  country
                             (ANSI).
                        4.   Guessit.  Let  the  computer  guess   something
                             about you.
                        5.   The financial menu.
                        6.   Return to the HOST.

                        M:Please enter your selection (1-6):

                        /p:eatumup.exe
                        /t:^C /p:4inarow.exe
                        /t:^C /r:^x /p:bigrig.exe
                        /g:off /p:guessit.exe
                        /i:FMENU

                        Please  note  that the  M:....,  and switches  must
                        start  on  the  left  margin   (preceded  by  CR/LF
                        sequence).

                        Note  that you can  chain menu's, so  that one menu
                        calls another.  When the program is exited, it will
                        return to  the top  level menu.   For  example, the
                        switch  line  containing: /I:FMENU  will   call  up
                        another menu which  will be presented  exactly like
                        this one.

                        The  M:  means that  it  is  to  stop  and input  a
                        selection number.  The selection numbers start with
                        0 and  runs 0-9,  then A-Z. Since  a blank  line is
                        between  the M: line  and the first  selection, the
                        menu in this case starts with 1.

                        The  command line  sets the  defaults  for ALL  the
                        programs in the menu. Thus the graphics will be ON,
                        and the ^K will cause  an external abort in all the
                        programs,  unless  set differently.    4inarow will
                        also trap for <CRTL-C>, and Big Rig will also abort
                        with  a <CRTL-X>.   "GUESSIT" has the  main command
                        line ANSI ON directive, overridden with the /G:OFF.



                                          4             DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                        The  m:... may  also be  used.   The "M:"  and "m:"
                        behave differently  on  timeouts.   The  "M:"  will
                        return to the  menu if there is a  keyboard or user
                        timeout, but the  "m:" will return to the  HOST. If
                        PCBOARD.SYS or DOOR.SYS is being read and using the
                        actual user's  time, it  is preferable  to use  the
                        small "m"; however if only  10 minutes in a door is
                        given, then the capital "M" would be more logical.

                        DOORWAY  can also password protect any door, or the
                        drop to    DOS.  Create a welcome file,  and on the
                        last line enter:

                             P:PASSWORD

                        For example:

                             Enter the password for exit to dos:
                             P:MONGOOSE

                        If this  is in the  INITIAL WELCOME  file for  your
                        DROP  TO DOS,  the  user will  see the  first line,
                        prompting  him for the  password. When  password is
                        entered,  dots will  echo  keyboard  entry. If  the
                        password is entered correctly, the door, or DROP TO
                        DOS in this case, will be executed.   Otherwise, he
                        will  get a message that the password is wrong, and
                        he will be returned to  the HOST.  The password may
                        be either upper  or lower case letters,  as DOORWAY
                        doesn't differentiate between them.























                                          5             DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                     B.      The APPLICATION PROGRAM

                        The application  program can be  virtually any .COM
                        or  .EXE  program.  It can  also  be  a .BAT  file,
                        provided a /C:DOS  is added to the  DOORWAY command
                        line. Note that the name  of the program to be run,
                        and the  path,  if not  in  the same  directory  as
                        DOORWAY, must be  given EXTENSION and ALL.  This is
                        because  COMMAND.COM  is  not  loaded  for   safety
                        reasons,  and to  conserve  memory.   Although  the
                        SYSOP   give   the  program   name   as  "BASIC.EXE
                        APPLICATION", it  is not  recommended. If  the user
                        was able to break the interpreted basic program, or
                        it  were to  abort on  a  critical error,  the user
                        would be in the  basic interpreter.  Then, he could
                        do  a shell command which loads COMMAND.COM, and be
                        in DOS.  After checking out the BASIC program, then
                        by all means  compile it so a break  will return to
                        DOORWAY, which will  in turn return control  to the
                        HOST.  If the program is being run from a different
                        directory than the logged directory,  and looks for
                        any  files  in  the  logged  directly,  it  may  be
                        necessary to  add a /CD to the DOORWAY command line
                        so  the program's directory will be logged prior to
                        execution.   If the application program has a shell
                        to  DOS capability  be sure  to  put a  /H:  in the
                        DOORWAY command line to prevent them from executing
                        a dos shell.

                     C.      The EXIT MESSAGE

                        This is essentially the same as the INITIAL WELCOME
                        FILE message,  but is  typed after  the application
                        program is run. The "$:" will  wait after that line
                        is output, just  as in the menu above,  but any [Y]
                        or [N] responses will be ignored by DOORWAY.

                     D.      The TRANSLATION TABLE

                        The  Translation   Table  allow  you   to  redefine

                   3.   INSTALLATION

                     A. The Batch File

                        The batch  file for  DOORWAY to  run a door  should
                        look something like this:

           DOORWAY COM1 /I:WEL /E:EXM /T:^C /R:^K /G:ON /S:\PCB /P:PROG.EXE

                        Or if you are using the configuration file:

                                 DOORWAY COM1 DOORWAY.CFG

                        If  you  are  using  the  configuration  file,  all
                        switches  are  identical  to what  is  used  on the
                        command  line.  Each  switch must be  on a separate
                        line.

                        The  COM  (or  PORT) selection  must  be  the first
                        command  line parameter  (unless you are  using the
                        DOOR.SYS file),  and the  program (or  /C:DOS if  a
                        drop to  dos) must be  the last, but  all the other
                        switches can be in any order.

                             DOORWAY > The DOORWAY program

                             COM1 >  The  com port  number.    Can be  COM1,
                             COM1:, COM2,  COM2:, COM3, COM3:, COM4,  COM4:,
                             PORT:AAAA:I, SYS, TBBS or LOCAL.   Also each of
                             these possibilities  can be  followed by a  "X"
                             or "F" or "D",  as COM1F or SYSF. The COM  will
                             be  overridden and  DOORWAY  will run  in local
                             mode if  the board was  signed on  locally, and
                             PCBOARD.SYS  or DOOR.SYS  is  found.   The  SYS
                             tells it to look for  the file DOOR.SYS instead
                             of PCBOARD.SYS in its current  directory.  This
                             generic  door   interface  file  contains   the
                             user's  name, port  number,  time left  and  so
                             forth. For the  actual construction of this SYS
                             file, look at the DOORSYS.DOC file included  in
                             this  package.   DOORWAY  will  make  use of  a
                             short form DOOR.SYS  or the "standard" DOOR.SYS
                             file  created  by  GAP,  Wildcat,  PCBOARD  and
                             other bulletin  board  packages.   You can  use
                             either   of   these   formats,   DOORWAY   will
                             determine which it is automatically.

                             The additional  COM3  and  COM4 support  allows
                             some COM ports, addressed as  COM3 and COM4, to
                             be used with DOORWAY.  The address  of the UART
                             base address must  be found in RAM at 40:4  and
                             40:6, for  DOORWAY to  find  the  ports.   COM3

                             will   use  interrupt  4  and   COM4  will  use
                             interrupt  3 (same as  COM1 and COM2).  If your
                             system  doesn't map  the addresses  of the  COM
                             ports into low memory, or  the port uses  other
                             than  these interrupt  requests, you  will have
                             to give DOORWAY the actual  address and IRQ  of
                             the COM port.  Use  the PORT:AAAA:I, where AAAA
                             is 4 hexadecimal digits of  the base address of
                             the  port,   and  I  is   a  hexadecimal  digit
                             indicating    the   interrupt    number.   (ie.
                             PORT:03F8:4 =  COM1).  If  you are  reading the
                             DOOR.SYS  file and  using a  non-standard port,
                             then  you  can  use  the  SYS:AAAA:I  format to
                             specify the address and IRQ.

                             If  the  additional  parameter  "F"  is  placed
                             after the COM or SYS,  then this tells  DOORWAY
                             to   use    a    Fossil    driver   for    it's
                             communications.  If  you are not familiar  with
                             Fossil  drivers,  then  do   not  use  the  "F"
                             parameter.    The  "D" is  similar,  and  tells
                             DOORWAY to use the Digiboard  calls if you  are
                             using a Digiboard multiple com board.

                             Also if you  place the additional parameter "X"
                             after the COM or  SYS, DOORWAY will  not do any
                             redirection,   but  will   still  monitor   the
                             carrier  and the  keyboard and user  time. This
                             is in case you have  a program already  written
                             as a door, but it  doesn't monitor these things
                             properly.  The "X" and "F" may both be used  in
                             that order.

                     C.      Detailed Switch Definitions

                        /A: Alarm (bell)  is enabled on the  Board computer
                        if ON, disabled if OFF.  If left out, the bell will
                        follow  the ALARM  setting  of  the PCBOARD.SYS  or
                        DOOR.SYS.     Default  =  OFF.  ie.  "/A:ON",  will
                        override the PCBOARD.SYS or DOOR.SYS setting.

                        /B: /B:X, /B:M, /B:MS, /B:Z.  These codes deal with
                        line 25 of the display.  If the application program
                        tries to position the cursor to line 25, some modem
                        programs, such as QMODEM, ignore the request, since
                        line  25 contains  the Modem's  status information.
                        This can be disastrous for some programs which also
                        write on this  line, since it will  appear randomly
                        on  the user's screen.   The  /B:X will  simply not
                        send any  characters which are on line  25, and the
                        /B:M will move  the screen up one  line eliminating
                        the top line.

                        If things do  not appear correctly when  the cursor
                        gets to the  bottom of the screen, try  adding /B:M
                        to  the command line. Generally, you will want this
                        switch for a drop to dos function, if you are using
                        a com program which will not allow you to eliminate
                        the  status line.   However,  if  your com  program
                        (Such  as QMODEM 4.0)  does allow you  to eliminate
                        the status line, it is highly recommended to do so,
                        and not use a /B:M.

                        DOORWAY will  send a  sequence which  will position
                        the cursor at the bottom  of the screen for both 24
                        and   25  line   modem  programs.      For  maximum
                        compatibility, it is highly recommended to put /B:M
                        or  /B:MS in  for  ALL  door  programs,  unless  it
                        specifically causes a  problem.  Since line  24 and
                        25 will  be going to line 24 if  you do a /B:M, you
                        may need to put  a /B:MS on a drop to  dos and some
                        text  programs.  This tells  DOORWAY to  scroll the
                        screen when it  moves the line from 25  to 24 (BIOS
                        mode  only), if the last  line written was line 24.
                        Otherwise,  you  may   find  that   line  24   gets
                        overwritten once, when  text is being printed.   If
                        you are  using the /L: and /B:M,  this will already
                        be taken care of by the /L: switch.

                        A  "Z" can  also be  placed in  this sequence.   It
                        tells  DOORWAY to NOT write the very last character
                        of  the bottom  line. Some  programs  will write  a
                        character there,  quite often  a space, making  the
                        remote's   screen   scroll,  when   it   shouldn't.
                        Obviously, you will  be missing a character  on the

                                          10            DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                        right of the screen if you do this, and a character
                        is supposed  to go there.   If the  comm program on
                        the  remote  end  scrolls  when  the  bottom  right
                        character is  written, then it  will be  absolutely
                        necessary to use the "Z".

                        The  /B: switch can  be eliminated entirely  if you
                        are  using DWCOMM  on the  remote  end, as  DOORWAY
                        senses  DWCOMM  and  will  configure  properly  for
                        maximum compatibility and capability.

                        /C:DOS or /C:VIA.   The /C: will  cause COMMAND.COM
                        to be loaded.  The /C:DOS will then exit to DOS and
                        allow you to  perform DOS functions over  the modem
                        for  remote computing.   Enter "EXIT" to  return to
                        the HOST.   You  do  not need  to  be in  the  same
                        directory  where the  DROP TO  DOS  occurred before
                        exiting from DOS.   The VIA function will load  the
                        program  (or  batch  file)  which follows  the  /P:
                        parameter   via  COMMAND.COM.    If  you  load  via
                        COMMAND.COM, then path searching will be  supported
                        and the path and extension of program name need not
                        be given.  Obviously, the DOS function is not for a
                        door at all, but for a REMOTE drop to DOS function.
                        You can do a DOORWAY  .... /C:DOS, either in a high
                        security  door, or  in the  REMOTE  batch file  for
                        REMOTE DROP TO DOS.

                        /CD Change  Directory into  the directory that  the
                        program is  in.  If  DOORWAY is being  run from one
                        directory and the program being shelled is run from
                        another  directory,  the program  may be  unable to
                        find some of  it's files.  Use this  switch to tell
                        DOORWAY  to change  directories into  the directory
                        the program is  in prior to executing  the program,
                        and then  change back  when execution is  complete.
                        IMPORTANT:  The path goes on the /P: parameter, not
                        on the /CD switch.

                        /D:  Disable   Disk  writes.     This  switch  will
                        intercept all DOS  calls and not allow  disk writes
                        to take  place.   This can be  handy for  a program
                        like a game which insists on  writing a score file.
                        It  may cause problems  for programs  which require
                        writing to disk to run.

                        /E: Name of  the EXIT MESSAGE file.   No message if
                        left  out. If graphics are ON,  will search for the
                        file  with an .ANS  extension and use  it if found.
                        See earlier section on the EXIT MESSAGE.

                        /F: Fast.  Functional  only if Graphics is 'ON' and
                        in  non-direct (BIOS) screen  mode.   Some programs
                        move  the   cursor  all  over   the  place  between
                        characters written, (Quick  Basic compilers tend to
                        do  this).  Each new  locate of the cursor normally
                        generates  an 8 character ANSI sequence to send out
                        the  modem.   For  some  games,  this unnecessarily
                        slows down the  action.  The /F: will  not send ANY
                        ANSI sequences on a cursor locate until a character
                        is  ready to  be written.    However, since  cursor
                        relocates are not done  until a character is  to be
                        written,  this  gives  the  strange effect  of  not
                        seeing  a Carriage Return  have any effect  until a
                        printable character  is sent to the modem.  It also
                        has the  strange effect  of having  the cursor  one
                        right  of  where  you would  expect,  if  you enter
                        backspaces  over something.    There  are very  few
                        cases  where  this  switch should  be  used,  if in
                        doubt, leave it out.

                        /FC Force carrier detect. This is for use with Null
                        modems cables.   It will not detect a  carrier loss
                        if used.

                        /G: ANSI GRAPHICs  enabled if ON, disabled  if OFF,
                        AUTO if A. If  left out, it will  be as defined  in
                        the PCBOARD.SYS, or DOOR.SYS file. Default is AUTO,
                        which asks the  remote if it can  support ANSI, and
                        configures automatically.   Forced on automatically
                        if DIRECT SCREEN is ON. (See /V switch)

                        /H: Halt  shells to DOS.   You  may want  to put  a
                        program into a door  which allows the user to shell
                        to dos (such as LIST).

                        This switch will  prevent the program from  doing a
                        shell to DOS.  Since a program may do a shell  in a
                        non-standard  way,  be  sure   to  verify  this  is
                        operational  with  any  program  before  making  it
                        available to general  users.  If the alarm  is "on"
                        DOORWAY will beep the HOST if anyone tries to shell
                        DOS.  Never use with a /C:DOS or the operation will
                        fail with an access denied error.

                        /I: Name of the WELCOME MESSAGE file. No message if
                        left out. If there are two files with the same name
                        but one of  them has the extension of  ANS, the ANS
                        (ANSI GRAPHICS) version will be used if graphics is
                        on.  See previous section on INITIAL WELCOME.

                        /J: Scroll threshold.  It is normally not required.
                        When direct screen writes  are turned on, scrolling

                        of the remote screen is determined by how many more
                        lines  match the  HOST  screen  if  the  screen  is
                        scrolled than if it is not.   The default threshold
                        is 5, and if  you set 25 or  more, then the  remote
                        will never scroll.

                        /K: KEYBOARD TIMEOUT TIMER.  The  /K: will accept a
                        number between 0 and 255 to define how  long, after
                        the  last character was received from the remote or
                        local keyboard, to wait before terminating the door
                        and returning to the  board. The /K:0 is  a special
                        case which will override keyboard timeouts totally,
                        (recommended for drop to dos).  Also, an operand of
                        "V" will reset the keyboard timer on each character
                        which is sent out the port.   This is useful if you
                        have a door which sends out 10 minutes of text with
                        no  keyboard   input  required.   The  user   would
                        otherwise be kicked out  of the door after about  4
                        minutes,  since he hadn't entered anything.  Do not
                        use  a /K:V on something like eatumup though, since
                        the continuous movement  of the monsters  will keep
                        the keyboard from timing out.  A /K:V100 will  give
                        a 100 second timeout, and reset the timer on video.

                        /L: Add line feeds when cursor is positioned at the
                        bottom of  the screen.   Various  ANSI.SYS's handle
                        the  scroll differently when they get to the bottom
                        of the screen.   Some do not do a  BIOS scroll, but
                        do  the   scroll  directly  without  doing  a  BIOS
                        interrupt.  Thus,  if you do a DIR  in DOS, it will
                        work until  you get  to the bottom  of the  screen;
                        then,  all further lines will  overwrite the bottom
                        line.   The  /L: will  check for  the  cursor being
                        addressed at the start of the bottom line and add a
                        Line Feed, if it is there.  If you have an ANSI.SYS
                        which  does the BIOS call, you will get double line
                        feeds if you add this switch. Another way of fixing
                        this is to  use a  different ANSI.SYS,  or try  the
                        ANSIPAT patch on your ANSI.SYS.  It  should work on
                        most  MSDOS's.    It  is  recommended  to  use  the
                        ANSIPAT, if  it will  work, and  leave this  switch
                        out.   DOS 5  ANSI does  not require  any patching.
                        ANSI.COM  from  PC  Magazine is  another  very good
                        alternative that  does  not need  patching  and  is
                        highly recommended.   It  is not  necessary to  use
                        this switch in direct screen mode.

                        /M: Maximum time  allowed.  This will  override the
                        time  computed  from  the PCBOARD.SYS  or  DOOR.SYS
                        file.  It is in minutes and has a maximum value  of
                        32766 minutes.  A time of 32767 minutes is entered,
                        it will  override timeouts completely.   Default is

                        10  minutes.     Negative  values  will  cause   an
                        immediate abort.

                        NOTE:
                             This  is  functional  on  registered   versions
                             ONLY! The demo version  will always default  to
                             10 minutes.

                        /N: NETWORK.  If the /N:  switch is set,  all files
                        will  be  opened  network  compatible.    Both  the
                        INITIAL WELCOME,  and EXIT MESSAGE  will be  opened
                        share compatible, and if  the program being shelled
                        opens  a file, DOORWAY will change its open command
                        to a  share compatible  "Allow read  - deny  write"
                        open command.   Note that  the PCBOARD.SYS/DOOR.SYS
                        file  is closed  immediately after  reading it,  so
                        there  is  no  problem  accessing  these  from  the
                        program  being  shelled.   COMMAND.COM often  has a
                        problem  with this  switch,  so  if you  experience
                        lock-up's  on  drop to  DOS,  try eliminating  this
                        switch.

                        /NCD No  delay on  carrier loss.  This is used  for
                        direct connects (NULL modem)  where a 1 to 2 second
                        DTR drop must terminate the application.

                        /O: Override  the  DOORWAY title  screen. This  can
                        ONLY  be  done  after  registering   your  copy  of
                        DOORWAY.     When  this  switch  is  used  a  short
                        introduction screen will still  give the user  name
                        and  time.  A  /O:T will also  eliminate the delays
                        associated with the opening screen (recommended for
                        drop to dos).  See REGISTRATION below.

                        /P: The program name with the extension and path if
                        not  in the  default directory.   This MUST  be the
                        last  switch  on  the   command  line.     Anything
                        following  the program name  will be passed  to the
                        program  as  a  command  line  parameter  for  that
                        program.   This is  not used for  a /C:DOS  switch.
                        The path  to the  program can  precede the  program
                        name if necessary.  If  the program is a batch file
                        then  a /C:VIA  must be  used to  load the  command
                        interpreter.

                        /Q:  Quick Basic.   This switch tells  DOORWAY that
                        the program being shelled is a Quick Basic ver. 4.0
                        program.   Doorway will intercept the DOS calls and
                        tell  the  program   that  its  output  is   to  be
                        redirected.   Without this  switch, these  programs
                        will do  direct screen writes.   If a  program will
                        not  send characters out the com port under DOORWAY

                        in  BIOS mode,  but  can  be  redirected  by  CTTY,
                        Gateway or  the ">"  symbol, then  this switch  may
                        allow DOORWAY to redirect it as well  in BIOS mode.
                        Note that a program expecting redirected output may
                        not   send   things   like   colors,   and   cursor
                        relocations.  Do not use this switch with a drop to
                        dos, as COMMAND.COM will not operate properly.  You
                        may  want  to  experiment  with  each  program  and
                        determine if performance is better in direct screen
                        write  mode (/V:D),  or with  this switch.    It is
                        recommended  that programs compiled with  QB 4.5 or
                        later use the  /V:D switch instead due  to problems
                        in the QB compiler when redirected.

                        /R:  RETURN (abort).   Each  of  these defines  one
                        character with  which to  abort the  program.   The
                        character, with which to abort, will be the control
                        equivalent if preceded by a  "^", such as a ^C, for
                        an  ASCII  3.    If  the user  enters  the  control
                        character, the sysop will see "EXTERNAL USER ABORT"
                        displayed.    If   the  Sysop  enters   the  return
                        character, then the  user and Sysop will  receive a
                        message which says, "THE SYSOP HAS REQUESTED YOU TO
                        RETURN  TO  THE  BOARD", and  the  program  will be
                        aborted.

                        /RB: REBOOT.  If you  use this switch then the HOST
                        computer  will  reboot   instead  of  breaking  the
                        application program on carrier loss and timeouts.

                        /S: Where  to  look for  .SYS  file. ie.  \PCB\  or
                        C:\WC30.   Doorway can  tell if the  PCBOARD.SYS is
                        version  11-12 or  version 14,  and  will read  and
                        interpret each properly without being told. If left
                        out, then  it will look in the  same directory that
                        DOORWAY is  in.  If  not found, then  the Graphics,
                        Alarm,  User  time  and  User  name  settings  will
                        default to  their "DEFAULT"  settings.   Thus, this
                        program is compatible with RBBS, WILDCAT, GT, OPUS,
                        RYBBS, QBBS, FORUM  and GENESIS as well.  For those
                        of  you  who  are running  a  BBS  which  does  not
                        generate a .SYS  file the search for  the .SYS file
                        can be totally over-ridden.  Adding  an /s:* to the
                        command line will  eliminate the delays  associated
                        with  looking  for  PCBOARD.SYS  or  DOOR.SYS   and
                        displaying  the "NOT FOUND"  message.  In  order to
                        reliably  run  on RBBS,  you  must set  RBBS  up to
                        continue  its batch file  and not shell  for doors.
                        DOORWAY can also  look for a generic  DOOR.SYS file
                        instead of PCBOARD.SYS by placing a "SYS" where the
                        com port normally goes in the command line.

                        /T:  TRAP  Characters.   Each  of  these  defines a
                        character to trap  out of the input.  If there is a
                        ^ in front of the  character, it will look for that
                        control character.   A  ^@ will  trap all  extended
                        codes.   Multiple  characters can  be  trapped (ie.
                        /T:^C^K).

                        /U: Get shadow  buffer from multi-tasker.   This is
                        primarily used for multi-taskers such as  Desqview.
                        If  Desqview 386  is  mapping  background video  to
                        addresses other  than the normal  video card,  this
                        switch may be necessary.  Usually you  will need to
                        either  select virtualize video  in DV 386,  or use
                        this  switch. Using both  will cause problems.   If
                        you are not  using a multitasker such  as Desqview,
                        do not use this switch!

                        /V:  Video  mode,  Direct  or  BIOS.    Instead  of
                        redirecting  the BIOS  calls for  VIDEO,  this will
                        tell  DOORWAY to check the Host's screen against an
                        image  DOORWAY   maintains.     When  it   sees   a
                        difference, it will  send it out the modem.  A /V:D
                        will  put it  in direct  screen  mode, a  /V:B (the
                        default)  in  BIOS  call  mode.   You  can  add  an
                        additional  character  to allow  switching  between
                        modes, such  as: /V:D^U  will start  out in  direct
                        screen  mode, but allow you to toggle between modes
                        with a  control U  (on remote  end only).  A screen
                        redraw can be accomplished by switching to BIOS and
                        back to  DIRECT.  It  is highly recommended  NOT to
                        use anything other  than a 25 line mode  on the com
                        end for  this, on a  DROP TO  DOS. A  /B:Z will  be
                        necessary, if your com program doesn't support mode
                        setting via  ANSI.   Otherwise,  the remote  screen
                        will  scroll  when the  cursor  reaches  the bottom
                        right of  the screen, and  the remote end  will get
                        very messed up.  When a large portion of the screen
                        has  changed, DOORWAY checks  to see if  the screen
                        scrolled,  and  if it  did, sends  a scroll  to the
                        remote. DOORWAY will check for up to 5 scrolls.  If
                        the  HOST gets  more than  5  scrolls ahead  of the
                        remote,  then  DOORWAY  will  start  rewriting  the
                        screen.  If  this happens, you may want  to enter a
                        ^S (for  such things as a dir in  DOS), and let the
                        remote catch  up with  the  HOST, so  they can  get
                        resynced.   It is  unlikely this will  be necessary
                        unless the HOST  is a  very fast  computer and  the
                        modem is operating  at a low baud rate  (Enter a ^Q
                        to restart).

                        Redirection of the Host's screen occurs  when there
                        are  keyboard or timer interrupts.  Thus the remote

                        will be  updated as  quickly as  possible when  the
                        program  is waiting for  a keyboard  interrupt, and
                        will still redirect, although more slowly, when not
                        checking keyboard interrupts.

                        /W: Pause at program termination. If you put in the
                        /W:  switch, it will  pause at the  completion of a
                        program.  It  will not pause if there  is a carrier
                        loss,  or  if  the program  was  terminated  by the
                        Sysop.  (Sysop has  requested  that  you return  to
                        BOARD).

                        /X:   Load  and  use  a  translation  table.    The
                        translation table can be generated  and modified by
                        using the included XTABLE.EXE program.   Additional
                        information can be found  in the translation  table
                        documentation   included   in   this   ZIP.     The
                        translation  table allows  redefining  any and  all
                        keys  from the  remote to  the  host.   Thus,  if a
                        program requires entering an [F10] to exit, you can
                        remap it to  a ^Q (control Q).   Some programs such
                        as QEDIT use  both the character and the  scan code
                        for  proper operation.   DOORWAY now  supplies scan
                        codes to the HOST's program. For instance, entering
                        the ESC key will put  QEDIT into command mode,  but
                        entering  a  ^[ or  ALT  27 will  instead  cause an
                        escape character  (back arrow)  to be  sent to  the
                        text file. 

                        Of course, if an ESC character is received over the
                        modem, there  is no  way to tell  which of  these 3
                        methods  were used to generate the ESCAPE.  DOORWAY
                        has a default set of scan codes, so when it sees an
                        ESC, it  tells QEDIT the  ESC key was  pressed.  If
                        you want  it to  tell QEDIT that  a ^[  was pushed,
                        then remap the ESC or some other key to a ^[ ESCAPE
                        with  XTABLE.EXE.  Several  other keys  are handled
                        differently, most notably, the  two sets of numbers
                        (DOORWAY defaults  to the ones  at the  top of  the
                        keyboard), and the  two "-" and "+"  signs (DOORWAY
                        defaults to  the white ones). For  more information
                        on  XTABLE, see  the XTABLE.DOC  file.  If you  are
                        running out of room on  the command line (DOS  only
                        lets  you put  127 characters on  a line),  you can
                        eliminate  the colons after the switches.  It makes
                        reading  the  line  more difficult,  so  it  is not
                        recommended  to leave  them out  unless  you really
                        need the space.  Also you can  use the DWCONFIG.EXE
                        generated  configuration  file   in  place  of  the
                        switches on the command line.

                        /Y:  Printer  trapping/redirection.   If  a  /Y: is
                        placed on the DOORWAY command line, then any output
                        to the  printer will  be discarded.   If a  /Y:R is
                        place  on the command  line, and DWCOMM  is used on
                        the remote end, the printer will be redirected over
                        the  modem to DWCOMM or other communication program
                        with printer redirection capability to either print
                        or save to a file on the remote end.

                        /Z: Use a custom exit message instead of "RETURNING
                        TO BOARD". Thus /Z:EXITM will substitute the  ASCII
                        text in  the file  EXITM for  the normal  returning
                        message.   Only  one line  of  information will  be
                        transmitted.  For  a  long  message,  use  the  /E:
                        capability. You  can personalize  this so it  says:
                        RETURNING TO DATA  WORLD BBS, or CONTINUING  TO THE
                        NEXT STEP in a multi door batch file.

                        /19: Use  the DOS interrupt  19 for rebooting  if a
                        reboot is ever necessary.   DO NOT USE  THIS SWITCH
                        FOR  NORMAL DOS SYSTEMS.  DOS  will usually lock up
                        with this interrupt.  However, under NTNX, Desqview
                        and other multi-taskers,  this switch is  necessary
                        for proper operation under a reboot condition.

                        /80: Force  80  column mode.   This  will force  an
                        application program to stay in 80 column mode.  The
                        primary purpose of  this is to avoid a  bug in some
                        versions of  Desqview 386, which causes problems if
                        a program writes to the screen in 40 column mode in
                        the background.

                        /*:  Exit  program  sequence.   Use  the  following
                        sequence  to  exit the  program.  The sequence  may
                        include up to 16 characters, control characters and
                        extended key codes.  For control characters use the
                        ^ in  front of the  character.  For  extended codes
                        precede the scan  code of the  character with a  @.
                        Scan  codes can be obtained by running the included
                        GIVESCAN.EXE program.   Please note that F2  and F4
                        scan codes are  the dos redirection symbols  (< and
                        >) and thus CANNOT be  put on the dos command line.
                        If you must use these  symbols you will have to use
                        the  new  configuration   file  capability.     Use
                        DWCONFIG  or  a  plain  text  editor  to  edit  the
                        configuration file.

                     DOORWAY  supports  Desqview  and  other  multi-Tasking
                     environments. You need not  even inform DOORWAY  about
                     the  Multitasker. In some  cases, primarily on pre-386
                     computers, you  may  be unable  to  use direct  screen
                     mode with multitaskers.

                     The   multitasker  should   be  set   up  to   run  in
                     background,  and  to not  allow swapping  of programs.
                     Either virtualize video should be  set to TRUE or  the
                     DOORWAY /U switch should be used, but not both.

                   6.   EXTENDED KEYBOARD CODE SUPPORT

                     DOORWAY supports all  extended character codes!   This
                     allows you to send it  the Function keys, Cursor keys,
                     and  ALT  functions.   Undefined  codes  and the  Ctrl
                     PrtSc code  are  trapped from  going  to the  program,
                     since some undefined codes can  crash the system.   If
                     you want to override all  extended codes, then enter a
                     /T:^@ on the command line, as  this will then trap the
                     NULL character.  At  this  time  most  modem  packages
                     support the ability  to send extended keyboard  codes.
                     The table  in appendix  B lists those  which claim  to
                     have DOORWAY  capability. Most of the comm programs go
                     into DOORWAY mode by  entering an ALT "="  (internal),

                     except for  GT Power,  which uses  a CRTL DOWN  Arrow,
                     and PROCOMM plus 2  which requires it to be  installed
                     for IBM PC emulation.  If your favorite  modem program
                     doesn't support extended key codes, you might  mention
                     this  much  needed  function to  your  favorite  modem
                     software vendor!

                     DOORWAY also supports the  enhanced keyboard.  If  the
                     com package  is capable  of sending the  enhanced keys
                     from remote,  then  doorway will  return  them to  the
                     program on the  HOST if an  enhanced keyboard call  is
                     performed.   Note that  if the HOST  does not  have an
                     enhanced keyboard, any program  on the HOST is  highly
                     unlikely   to  ask   for  enhanced   codes,  and  will
                     therefore not get them.   Standard extended codes  are
                     encoded  as a  NULL followed  by  the SCAN  CODE.   E0
                     enhanced  extended  codes  are encoded  as  "NULL  E0H
                     SCANCODE",  where  the   E0H  is   a  hexadecimal   E0
                     character.

                     Many people are  now using DOORWAY  for a remote  DROP
                     TO DOS  or REMOTE  redirection program.   This can  be
                     done with the following  command line for either  your
                     drop to dos door or remote batch file:

             DOORWAY COM1 /i:pword /g:on /a:on /m:100 /v:d^U /s:* /c:dos

                     I like  to turn the alarm  on, so if anyone  gets into
                     DOS  I will hear  any beeps.   You will need  to use a
                     com program which  supports 25 line  mode.  The  above
                     also  sets ANSI  graphics on.   The  /m:100 gives  100
                     minutes in  dos, and  the /c:dos tells  it to  drop to
                     dos.  The  /i:pword allows password protection  before
                     an exit  to DOS  is allowed,  and may  be left out  if
                     desired.   See the discussion  on the password  in the
                     INITIAL WELCOME  discussion above.  The /V:D^U puts it
                     in direct screen  write mode,  for compatibility  with
                     virtually  all programs,  and the  ^U allows  toggling
                     between the  modes,  for a  screen  redraw if  nothing
                     else.  You may need a  /B:Z, depending on whether your
                     com program  handles the "^[[7l" ansi sequence or not.
                     (If you see a "^[[?7l" or  "^[[?7h" tell the author of
                     your com package).   A /B:M will be needed, if you are
                     unable to  eliminate  the status  line  on the  remote
                     end.

                     The reasons  for using DOORWAY  for your  drop to  dos
                     are many.

                     Here are a few of the more obvious ones:

                                                             CTTY  DOORWAY

                         Allows cursor keys to be sent        no      yes
                         Allows keyboard redefinition         no      yes
                         Allows password protection           no      yes
                         Allows trapping of characters        no      yes
                         Monitors carrier                     no      yes
                         Monitors user time                   no      yes

                         Allows you to externally abort pgms. no      yes
                         Gives 24 hours support via BBS       no      yes
                         Allows you to inhibit disk writes    no      yes
                         Supports Fossils                     no      yes

                     With  /V:D switch in the  command line, the SETUP (for
                     your  BBS) can be  run from remote if  you are using a
                     modem package which  supports the extended  key codes.
                     The cursor, page up, and  page down, and function keys
                     will  all  be  handled  as  if  entered  on  the  HOST
                     keyboard.  You  can move  around the  pages, and  also
                     enter the  ALT F to  find a  string.   In dos, the  F3
                     will repeat  the last  command and in  EDLIN, you  can
                     use the F3, cursor, ins, and  delete keys, just as you
                     would at the main keyboard.

                     You will  find you  can do lots  of things  which CTTY
                     disallows.

                     Try a "COPY CON: FILENAME" with  CTTY and it will lock
                     up, but  works fine  with DOORWAY.   To exit  the COPY
                     CON:  enter a  ^Z.   Once you  get used  to a  DOORWAY
                     REMOTE DROP TO DOS, you will  wonder how you got along
                     without it.

                   8.  USER ABORTS AND LOST CARRIERS

                     If a user enters  one of the characters following  the
                     /R: in  the  DOORWAY command  line,  then the  program
                     will abort.  "EXTERNAL  USER ABORT" will be  displayed
                     on the Sysop's  screen for a couple of  seconds.  Note
                     that  if the  user  does an  EXTERNAL  ABORT when  the
                     program  is  in a  CRITICAL  DOS  function, the  abort

                                          21            DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                     could crash the system.   Therefore, if a critical DOS
                     function  is  being  performed,  the  abort   will  be
                     delayed (but  remembered) until  it is safe  to abort.
                     If the  user does an external  abort during a  drop to
                     DOS  (REMOTE  session),  the function  or  program  in
                     process will be aborted, and  the user will be dropped
                     back  to DOS, and the  message "EXTERNAL ABORT IN DOS"
                     will appear on both ends.

                     If a  carrier is lost, the  program will abort,  or if
                     in  DOS an  EXIT will  be performed,  and control will
                     return  to  the  HOST   program  automatically.    The
                     message "CARRIER LOST  >>>>> RETURNING TO  BOARD" will
                     flash up  on the  HOST's screen.   If carrier  is lost
                     during a critical DOS  function, DOORWAY will  attempt
                     to  abort the program  for 255 seconds.   DOORWAY goes
                     to  great   lengths  to  abort  a  program  which  was
                     previously  unbreakable.   It  will resort  to hooking
                     the dos  interrupts to  gain control, and  sending the
                     program  carriage returns,  ESC characters,  and ^C's.
                     If unable  to break the program  for 255 seconds, then
                     the  system will reboot.  The only way I know for this
                     to  happen, is  if the  program running  under DOORWAY
                     hangs up, but  timer ticks are still functioning.   If
                     this  happens, and the user  hangs up, then the system
                     would  be  hung  until   the  Sysop  noticed  it   and
                     rebooted.  Therefore, Doorway will reboot the system.

                     If  a User  or keyboard  timeout occurs,  then DOORWAY
                     will send  the appropriate  message and return  to the
                     bulletin  board or host.  If a keyboard timeout occurs
                     in DOS  (/C:DOS), then the bell  will be rung,  but it
                     will not return to the BBS.

                     If  the  program responds  badly  to  being externally
                     aborted  (leaves   memory  allocations,   files  areas
                     locked  etc.), you  can  use the  /*:  switch to  have
                     DOORWAY send the program  an exit sequence for  proper
                     closedown.

                   9.   REGISTRATION

                     This  DOORWAY  program  is  strictly  a non-registered
                     demo version.  The  exact terms of this  agreement are
                     given  fully in  APPENDIX 2,  but the  following  is a
                     "plain  english"  condensation.   This  non-registered
                     version  may  be freely  distributed  and  uploaded to
                     BBS's.   It  can be  tested  and used  for one  month.
                     After that date, the program  may not be used,  unless
                     it is registered.   You may register it  several ways.
                     First, you  may fill out the  order blank on  the next
                     page or in the file REGISTER.FRM  and send it with the
                     appropriate amount (see below) to:

                            TriMark Engineering, Attn. Marshall Dudley
                            406 Monitor Lane
                            Knoxville, Tn. 37922

                     Second, you may call the support  BBS, and go into the
                     DOORWAY registration  door  (DOOR    18),  which  will
                     allow you to register your software on-line in  only a
                     couple  of minutes.    After  verification,  you  will
                     receive your registration number  while you wait.   Be
                     sure and have either  your VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER,
                     or AMEX card handy before entering the door.

                     Lastly, you can call  (voice) the DOORWAY ORDER  LINE.
                     In  the  US you  can  call  1-800-OPN-DRWY (1-800-676-
                     3799).  This  number is strictly an order  line.  Tech
                     support cannot  and will not be  offered on this line.
                     Tech support  is offered  at 615-966-3667.   Faxes may
                     also  be sent to 615-966-3667.   If  you are local, or
                     out  of   the  country,  you  can   call  615-966-DOOR
                     (615-966-3667)  or 615-966-0058 to order.  Once again,
                     have your credit card handy.

                     When you  register,  you will  receive a  Registration
                     number for your copy of DOORWAY.   This number will be
                     valid for  your  board  for  future  versions  of  the
                     shareware  DOORWAY program,  no matter  when or  where
                     you get  them.  You will  be registered for  access to
                     all  private nodes  for 1  year,   and given  complete
                     support (If  you don't get registered, leave a message
                     to  the   sysop   or  page   him).     Defeating   the
                     registration,  or distributing a registered version of
                     DOORWAY  is illegal.   Make  sure that  any copies  of
                     DOORWAY   you   make   available   for    others   are
                     NON-REGISTERED!   Use of any programs intended to deny
                     the publisher of DOORWAY their  legal compensation for
                     use  of  DOORWAY  are  illegal.    Violators  will  be
                     prosecuted.

                                        QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

                        Q. I have  typed DOORWAY LOCAL, but all  it does is
                        print a screen of information and return to DOS.

                        A. DOORWAY  is not a  door itself.   It turns other
                        programs into doors.  Thus, unless you are using it
                        for a drop to dos, you will need  a /P:FILENAME.EXT
                        as the last switch on the command line.  For a drop
                        to dos you must have a /C:DOS switch.

                        Q. I  am using DOORWAY  for my remote  drop to dos.
                        It seems to work fine, except when a directory gets
                        to the bottom line of  the screen, one of the lines
                        gets  overwritten. Also, back spaces do not work on
                        the bottom line, but become spaces.

                        A.  You are  using  a communication  program  which
                        places  a status  line on  the bottom  line  of the
                        screen.   Therefore, attempts to address the cursor
                        on the bottom line are being ignored  by your modem
                        software.    This  is not  a  DOORWAY  problem, but
                        DOORWAY will solve it if  you put a /B:MS switch in
                        the command line.

                        Q. DOORWAY used to work great for my compiled BASIC
                        programs.   Now it  won't send  the characters  any
                        more.

                        A. You  have moved  from QUICK BASIC  1, 2 or  3 to
                        QUICK BASIC 4, or Turbo Basic.  The compilers  have
                        quit using the MSDOS/IBM specifications for sending
                        characters to the screen.   Instead of using DOS or
                        BIOS interrupts,  they  are writing  to the  screen
                        memory  directly.    Thus,  it   is  impossible  to
                        redirect  by  normal means.    Either  include  the
                        (Q)uick  Basic switch "/Q:"  (this only  works with
                        QBASIC version  4.0) in  the command  line, compile
                        with  a  pre-4 version  of QUICK  BASIC, or  set up
                        DOORWAY to use the direct screen mode (/V:D).

                        Q. I  am using  DOORWAY for my  remote drop  to dos
                        also, but when it gets  to the bottom of the screen
                        on a DIR listing, I  don't get ANY more line feeds,
                        and all lines  overwrite the previous lines  on the
                        bottom.

                        A.  There are several  versions of ANSI.SYS.   Some
                        are  better behaved than  others.  Some  of them do
                        NOT do a  BIOS scroll when they get  to the bottom,
                        but  instead do  a  block  move  in  video  memory.
                        DOORWAY has no way of trapping this "blind scroll".

                                          27            DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                        Therefore, DOORWAY can be  made to send a line feed
                        when  it  appears that  a  scroll was  done.   Just
                        insert  a /L:  in the  command  line to  get  it to
                        insert extra line feeds.  If you put this switch in
                        and  don't need it, you  will get double line feeds
                        at the  bottom.   A better solution  is to  try the
                        ANSIPAT in this ZIP. It should work on most MSDOS's
                        which exhibit  this problem.  DOORWAY is compatible
                        with  ANSI.COM, the  PC magazine  ANSI driver,  and
                        this is a very good substitution.

                        Q. I can't seem to get DOORWAY to give me more than
                        10 minutes before it aborts.

                        A.  Either you don't  have a registered  version or
                        else DOORWAY  cannot find PCBOARD.SYS  or DOOR.SYS,
                        and you  have  not defined  a maximum  time on  the
                        command line with a  /M:XXX (where XXX is the  time
                        in minutes).

                        Q.  DOORWAY seems  to  work fine,  but  when it  is
                        through, the board doesn't come back up.

                        A.  Check  your  Board  documentation  for  how  to
                        implement  doors.  For  PCBOARD, you need  to place
                        the  line "BOARD"  (or  whatever    you  named  the
                        board's batch  file)  after  the  "DOORWAY  XXXXXX"
                        line,   or   select  SHELL   for   the   method  of
                        implementation.   This   will  be   different   for
                        different  board softwares.  See  the example  .BAT
                        files   for  guidance.     For  RBBS,  it   is  not
                        recommended to shell to DOORWAY.

                        Q.  DOORWAY seems to  work from the  board end, but
                        gives and receives no response from the modem.

                        A. Check  that you  have defined  the correct  COM:
                        port in the command line. Verify DOORWAY is reading
                        the correct  .SYS file.   If you are  using com3 or
                        com4 try the PORT:AAAA:I or SYS:AAAA:I switch.

                        Q. When I run  DOORWAY, many programs will not send
                        anything  out   the  com  port,  but  user  entered
                        characters are received ok.  What's the problem?

                        A. You are using an "ENHANCED" ANSI driver, such as
                        FANSI,  NANSI, or  ZANSI.  These  do direct  screen
                        writes instead of BIOS calls, so DOORWAY never sees
                        the characters go to the screen. Replace the driver
                        with  the ANSI  driver  which  comes  with  DOS  or
                        ANSI.COM  from PC magazine.  Also, the programs you
                        are  running may  be  doing  direct screen  writes.

                                          28            DOORWAY 2.22 MANUAL




                        These can not be  redirected normally.  You may try
                        putting a  "/Q:" in the  command line to  see if it
                        will  support  redirection  of  output, or  set  up
                        DOORWAY for direct screen write mode (/V:D).

                        Q. Why do you read everything from the command line
                        instead  of from a  config file like everyone  else
                        does?

                        A.  We now support a configuration file if desired.
                        See the DWCONFIG.EXE program.

                        Q. I am very confused  on the order of the switches
                        in the DOORWAY command line.

                        A. There  are only two  things which have  to be in
                        any particular  place. The  COM1, COM2,  SYS, PORT,
                        TBBS or LOCAL must be the first item after DOORWAY,
                        and either  /C:DOS or  /P:FILENAME.EXT must  be the
                        last switch on the command line.

                        Q. I am using DOORWAY  in direct screen mode.  When
                        the cursor gets  to the bottom  of the screen,  the
                        screen gets really messed up.  What can I do?

                        A. You  either have a 24 line  com program running,
                        or  your com  program isn't translating  the "don't
                        wrap  line"  ansi sequence.    Use  a  25 line  com
                        program  and use  a /B:Z  or a  version of  the com
                        program which supports the ansi.

                        Q.  I have  registered DOORWAY,  and  now I  find a
                        later  version  on a  local  board.  Do  I have  to
                        register it also to use it?

                        A.  Your registration number is good for all future
                        versions  of  the   standard  edition  of  DOORWAY.
                        Simply register it  just like you did  your earlier
                        version.   If you have lost  your number, then type
                        DOORWAY  REGISTER on  your earlier  version  and it
                        will give  your board name and  registration number
                        back to  you.  Be  sure you have  your registration
                        number before copying the new version over the old!

                        Q.  I registered  DOORWAY  some time  ago.   Now  I
                        notice the price is higher for the new version with
                        direct screen write capability.  I think it is well
                        worth  it, but do  I need  to send the  full $30 or
                        just the difference?

                        A. We have always said that if you register DOORWAY
                        all future versions are free.   We stand behind our

                        word.  You  supported us when we had  less to offer
                        and it is only fair for us to support you. There is
                        no additional charge.

                        Q.  I have  had to change  my board  name.   I have
                        already  paid   for   DOORWAY  but   now  it   says
                        "REGISTERED TO:" my old board's  name.  What can  I
                        do?

                        A. Once we verify  that you have really changed the
                        board name, you  can get a new  registration number
                        for  the new name one time.  Note that the old name
                        and registration number will no longer be valid and
                        it will  be illegal  to use them.   If  you foresee
                        that you may change the name of  the BBS, or do not
                        run a BBS, then we recommend registering DOORWAY in
                        your personal name.

                        Q. I am running multi-nodes.  Do I have to register
                        more than one copy?

                        A. If all  nodes have the same board  name, and are
                        at the  same  location, then  one  registration  is
                        valid for  up to  5 nodes.   If  you are using  the
                        program privately for  a remote utility, it  can be
                        placed on multiple machines AS LONG AS NO MORE THAN
                        ONE  COPY HAS A POSSIBILILITY OF BEING RUN AT ONCE.
                        For  instance,  you  could  put  it  on  both  your
                        computer at  work and  at home, so  you can  log in
                        either way.  This does  not mean that a company can
                        have a copy on a BBS and all the employees can take
                        it home.

                        Q.  When I  try to  use the  cursor keys,  function
                        keys, or  ALT keys  either nothing  happens, or  my
                        program exits.  What switches do I need.

                        A. The problem is not with DOORWAY but whatever com
                        program you are calling in with.  Check appendix B.
                        Although  most  IBM  com   programs  can  send  the
                        function, ALT  and cursor keys a few cannot.  Those
                        that can may have to be switched into DOORWAY mode.
                        PROCOMM  PLUS  2  must  be  installed  for  IBM  PC
                        emulation, but will still not send the ALT keys.

                        Q. Why should I register DOORWAY?

                        A.  It allows  you  to  do some  other  things  not
                        available if you  do not register it. Also,  I have
                        spent thousands  of hours  creating a good  package
                        which is  needed  by the  BOARD  community.  Future
                        changes  to PCBOARD  and  compilers  can make  door

                        programs  not  work  anymore. The  only  way  I can
                        continue  supporting this product  is if  those who
                        are   using   it   support   my   efforts   through
                        registration.   Let's be honest.  The closest thing
                        to this program will cost  you over $100, so $30 is
                        a  very good  deal.   If you  put 10  programs into
                        DOORWAY, that is only $3.00 each,  and for a remote
                        drop to  DOS,  it is  unmatched.   User support  is
                        directly responsible  for the  latest version  with
                        direct screen write mode. I would like to give many
                        thanks to those who have supported us.

                        Q. I can't  seem to get DOORWAY to  work with 4DOS.
                        What am I doing wrong?

                        A.  Doorway will work  fine with 4DOS,  except 4DOS
                        will use the  ^ as an end of line.   Therefore, you
                        cannot use a ^ in  the DOORWAY command line, or you
                        will need  to set  up 4DOS  to use  something other
                        than   a  ^  for   this  function.     Most  people
                        reconfigure 4DOS to use the ~ instead.

                        Q. How do I get DSZ to work under DOORWAY?

                        A. The problem with using DSZ under DOORWAY is that
                        the block transfer information, which DSZ writes to
                        the local screen on the HOST, is being sent out the
                        modem with the data,  thus causing CRC errors.  The
                        simple  solution  is  to   either  upgrade  version
                        12-14-92  or  later  of DSZ,  or  use  the provided
                        DWS.BAT and DWR.BAT files,  which will turn DOORWAY
                        redirection on and off.

                        Q.  When I type DOORWAY REGISTER the computer locks
                        up.  What am I doing wrong?

                        A. You  probably  have a  memory  resident  program
                        which  is  not  handling   the  keyboard  interrupt
                        properly.

                        Q. Will DOORWAY work under PCMOS?

                        A.  Starting with  version  2.12, DOORWAY  is PCMOS
                        aware, and will  pass off to other  partitions when
                        waiting for a character input.

                                        APPENDIX A

                     DOORWAY will return  error codes  when it exits.    If
                     you  use an ERRORLEVEL   in the  batch  file,  it  can
                     determine  the following  reasons for  the termination
                     of the DOORWAY door.

                     0 - Normal  program termination (as far  as DOORWAY is
                             concerned).
                     1 -  External Abort,  user  entered  character defined
                             by the /R:
                     2 - Carrier Lost
                     3 - Keyboard Timeout
                     4 - Time Limit Exceeded
                     5 - Reboot (you should never get this one)
                     6 - Local Abort,  sysop entered the character  defined
                             by the /R:
                     7 - File  not found, one of  the files were  not found
                             by DOORWAY.
                     8 - Syntax Error
                     9 - DOS must be version 3.0 or later
                     10- reserved
                     11- Code is corrupted
                     12- Password failure

                     In  addition,  error codes  returned  by  DOS and  the
                     program  will   be   returned   in   a   file   called
                     DWSHELL.ERR.   The actual  error code returned  by DOS
                     or the  program will be written  in this log,  and the
                     source will be identified as the program or DOS.

                     Because  some  com  programs  will  not  accept   some
                     characters,  or will  mess  up  with some  characters,
                     several  characters have  been  translated by  DOORWAY
                     before sending out  the modem (when  DWCOMM is NOT  on
                     the remote  end).  These  are: the little  solid right
                     and left arrows  get translated to a "<"  and ">", the
                     ESC  which  shows  up  as  a  small  left  arrow  gets
                     translated to  a "<",  and the form  feed, which  is a
                     circle with  a +  at the bottom  gets translated  to a
                     script "f".

                     Many  of  the communications  programs  have  recently

                        nature whatsoever that  you or any other  party may
                        have against  LICENSOR  resulting from  use of  the

                        writing by you of the claim within 30 days of the  
                        incident  or occurrence giving  rise to  the claim,

                        if  LICENSOR has been advised of the possibility of
                        such damages.   You further agree  that if for  any
                        reason the LICENSOR is found to be liable to you as
                        a result of  your use of the program  and software,
                        that  as  partial  consideration  of  the  LICENSOR
                        granting   you  this   license,   you  agree   that
                        LICENSOR'S sole and  exclusive cumulative liability
                        to  you  or others  shall  be no  greater  than the
                        amount of any registration  fee paid by you.   SOME
                        STATES  DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF
                        LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
                        SO  THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
                        TO YOU.

                            (5)  Proprietary Protection

                                   (a)   The  Program  is furnished  to  you
                        for the sole  purpose of enabling you  to determine
                        whether to register Program with the LICENSOR.  You
                        shall  use the Program solely for such purpose, and
                        shall not, without  the prior  written approval  of
                        the LICENSOR,  either allow any third party to use,
                        or  yourself use, the Program for any other purpose
                        or for the benefit of any third party.

                                   (b)  This  Agreement conveys to you  only
                        a  limited   right  of  use,  fully   revocable  in
                        accordance with the provisions of  this Agreement. 
                        Except for such right of  use, you shall not assert
                        any right, title, or interest in or  to the Program
                        or any pertinent documentation.

                                   (c)  The  LICENSOR hereby represents, and
                        you  hereby  acknowledge,   that  the  program  and
                        software contain substantial  Trade Secrets of  the
                        LICENSOR; such Trade Secrets have been entrusted to
