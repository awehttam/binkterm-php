                           DWCOMM DOCUMENTATION

This program is included with DOORWAY to serve as the REMOTE communications
program with DOORWAY.  This program is NOT intended to be an all around
COM program.  For complete communications capability continue to use QMODEM
or your favorite COM program.  

You are licensed to use up to 5 copies of this program for each copy of
DOORWAY. Site licences are available. In conjunction with DOORWAY and DWHOST,
it is intended to allow easy access to a DOORWAY remote system.

MAIN MENU

When DWCOMM is run a menu will pop up.  This is the command menu.  For first
time operation, select the C)onfigure selection, and verify or change the
fields as necessary (see the configuration section below).

Buffer - Entering a "B" will switch the capture buffer on and off.  The capture
         buffer name is in the configuration menu.  Note that the ANSI
         sequences will be included in the file, so to view the capture file
         later will require a DOS type command, or an ANSI editor.

Config - Configure the com program for the correct com port, speed, capture
         filename, number to dial, and modem initialization string.  Press
         ESC to exit.  Upon exiting you will receive the options of quitting
         without saving new configuration information, exiting and saving the
         information, or continueing with the configuration. Switch between
         TOUCH TONE and PULSE dialing by entering an ALT T and ALT P.

Dial   - Dial the number from the configuration file.  If the number is blank
         DWCOMM will ask for the number to dial.  To abort enter ESC.

Init   - Initialize the modem by sending it the initialization string from
         the configuration file.  This function is called automatically when
         the program is first brought up.

Receive- Run the batch file DWR.BAT.  This batch file should be set up to
         allow the transfer protocol of choice to be run.  The included batch
         file is to use DSZ for ZMODEM.

Send   - Run the batch file DWS.BAT.  This batch file should be set up to
         allow the transfer protocol of choice to be run.  The included batch
         file is to use DSZ for ZMODEM.

Term   - Terminal mode. This mode is entered automatically after a Dial also.
         When in this mode all keystrokes go to the modem, and all characters
         received from the modem will be displayed.  ANSI is emulated.  To
         return to the MENU press both SHIFT keys at once.

Xfer   - Xfer using DWXFER.  This will bring up the DWXFER window, allowing
         you to use this windowed interface for transferring files.

Quit   - Quit DWCOMM and return to DOS.

CONFIGURATION MENU

COM PORT  This allows you to select the appropriate port.  Enter COM:1, COM:2,
          COM:3, COM:4 for a standard com port.  Enter LOCAL for local testing.
          Enter PORT:XXXX:Y where XXXX is the hexidecimal base address of the
          com port, and Y is the irq (1-9) for non-standard ports.

CAPTURE   This is the name you wish the capture file to be written to.  It is
          toggled on and off by the main menu "B" entry.

BAUD RATE This is the opening BAUD rate you wish to use with the modem.
          Normally this is the highest rate the modem will work at.  Not
          recommend to set above 38400.

LOCK PORT When the modem connects it will return a CONNECT string.  Some
          modems require the baud rate to be changed to the rate indicated
          in the connect string.  Other modems require the rate to be set at
          and remain at the initial setting.  Selecting YES will prevent
          the rate from dropping to the rate indicated in the CONNECT message.

INIT STRG This is the string sent to the modem when the program is brought up,
          and when Initialize modem is selected from the main menu.

NUM DIAL  This is the number dialed when "D" is selected at the main menu.
          If this field is left blank, the user is prompted for the number
          to dial.  Once the number is dialed, the program will wait for a
          CONNECT from the modem, then switch into the TERMINAL mode.  If BUSY
          or other error occurs, will redial number.

LPT1-LPT3 DOORWAY has the ability to redirect printer outputs when a /Y:R is
          included in the command line.  When the printer information is
          received by the remote, it is tagged as to whether it is going to
          lpt1, lpt2, or lpt3.  This allows you to have 0 to 3 printers on
          the remote end, and control where the redirection goes.  For instance
          if you only have one printer on the remote, all 3 could go to LPT1,
          or PRN.  If you have no printer, you could put a filename in the
          entry, and all printer output will be written to the disk.  And
          if you have 3 printers on the remote, each will respond seperately
          and properly.  This feature is available only if DWCOMM is use.

COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

DWCOMM can be executed with several command line switchs.  The following
switchs are available:

A - Use ANSI for cursor keys instead of DOORWAY codes.  Switchs automatically
    to DOORWAY mode when you enter DOORWAY, and back to ANSI when you leave.
B - Use BIOS calls, for Digiboard and Fossil support.
C - Automatically exits upon carrier loss.
R - Force use of regular keyboard calls, even if an enhanced keyboard is
    detected.
