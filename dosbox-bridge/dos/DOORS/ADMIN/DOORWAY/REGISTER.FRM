                           REGISTRATION FORM

This DOORWAY program is strictly a non-registered demo version. The exact
terms of this agreement are given fully in APPENDIX C, but the following
is a "plain english" condensation.  This non-registered version may be
freely distributed and uploaded to BBS's.  It can be tested and used for
one month.  After that date, the program may not be used, unless it is
registered.  You may register it several ways.  First, you may fill out
the order blank on the next page or in the file REGISTER.FRM and send it
with the appropriate amount (see the from on following page) to:

              TriMark Engineering, Attn. Marshall Dudley
              406 Monitor Lane
              Knoxville, Tn. 37922

Second, you may call the support BBS, and go into the DOORWAY registration
door (DOOR  18), which will allow you to register your software on-line in
only a couple of minutes.  After verification, you will receive your
registration number while you wait.  Be sure and have either your VISA,
MASTERCARD, DISCOVER, or AMEX card handy before entering the door.

Lastly, you can call (voice) the DOORWAY ORDER LINE.  In the US you can
call 1-800-OPN-DRWY (1-800-676- 3799). This number is strictly an order
line. Tech support cannot and will not be offered on this line.  Tech
support is offered at 615-966-3667.  Faxes may also be sent to
615-966-3667.  If you are local, or out of  the country, you can  call
615-966-DOOR (615-966-3667) or 615-966-0058 to order.  Once again, have
your credit card handy.

When you register, you will receive a Registration number for your copy of
DOORWAY.  This number will be valid for your board for future versions of
the shareware DOORWAY program, no matter when or where you get them. You
will be registered for access to all private nodes for 1 year,  and given
complete support (If you don't get registered, leave a message to the
sysop or page him).  Defeating the registration, or distributing a
registered version of DOORWAY is illegal.  Make sure that any copies of
DOORWAY you make available for others are NON-REGISTERED!  Use of any
programs intended to deny the publisher of DOORWAY their legal
compensation for use of DOORWAY are illegal.  Violators will be
prosecuted.

Once you have your registration number, go into the subdirectory that
DOORWAY is in and type "DOORWAY REGISTER". DOORWAY will ask for your

interchanged). Then, enter the registration number you have received, and
it will automatically  register  the  software  to  your registered name.
