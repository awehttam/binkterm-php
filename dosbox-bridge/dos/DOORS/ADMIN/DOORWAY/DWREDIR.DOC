					DWREDIR

DWREDIR allows you to turn DOORWAY redirection on and off.  For instance,
lets say you are in dos, and wish to transfer a file called temp.doc from
your host to your remote using DSZ then place following batch files in your
dos, in the path (DSZ versions after 12-14-91 do not require this):

file - SZ.BAT:

dwredir off
dsz dx %1
dwredir on

file - RZ.BAT:

dwredir off
dsz rz
dwredir on

Then you could type sz temp.doc, and the batch file will take care of turning
DOORWAY on and off for you and tell DSZ to send temp.doc.  If you type rz,
then that batch file will receive the data for you.  Of course you can use
DWXFER, which is easier to use, but slower than DSZ.

Note that DSZ 12-14-91 and later autodetect DOORWAY and will disable DOORWAY
automatically.
