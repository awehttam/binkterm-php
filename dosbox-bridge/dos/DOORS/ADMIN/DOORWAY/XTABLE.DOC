                           XTABLE.EXE INSTRUCTIONS

DOORWAY now has a new capability.  It can redefine keyboard entries made at
the remote end, including hotkeys.  Thus if you have a program which requires
a F10 to be pressed to exit, you can now redefine some other key, such as "Q"
or ^Q, to be an F10.  There are no restrictions on redefinitions (except you
cannot redefine the RETURN key).  Once the F10 is redefined as a "Q" then the
user can enter a "Q" to exit the program, and the program will receive an
F10.

To use the table generator enter XTABLE at the dos prompt.  If you already have
a table, it will print the translations already in the table.  It will then ask
if you want to modify the present table or erase it and start a new one.  The
last definition entered for a key will be the one kept, so if you make a
mistake simply enter it again.  On each line enter the character you want
translated followed by the character you want it translated to.  In the above
example you would enter "Q" followed by "F10".

Xtable will then ask you if you want to implement any not keys.  A hot key
is where a memory resident program will "pop up" when a certain combination
of keys are pressed.  Programs such as SETUP (for the printer) and Sidekick
are hot key initiated.  Hot keys differ from normal translations by several
things.  First, some hot keys do not use any character keys at all, but look
for a combination of the control, alt, and shift keys.  Others which look for
things like an ALT 1, require a hardware keyboard interrupt.  If you implement
a HOT KEY, the it can fake these things.  Note that virtually all hot key
programs do direct screen writes.  If they are not turned on, then the
window will not pop up.

When entering hot keys, enter the character to translat from.  Then RELEASE
all keys, and enter the combo you want translated to.  It will be captured
when you release the keys for non-character combos.

The number in paranthesis shows the HEX value passed.  For normal characters
the lower two bytes are the ASCII, and the first 2 bytes are the scan code.
For extended codes, the last two bytes are 0 and the first two are again the
scan code.  The table starts out with a default, such that a character from
the remote will generate the "most likely" scan code.  For instance the "+"
will generate the scan code for the SHIFT "=" plus sign.  If you want the
program to see what appears to be the GREY KEY "+" then simply enter a plus
sign followed by the GREY KEY "+".  Using the default DOORWAY.XLT is the same
as using no translation table at all (DOORWAY will still put the "expected"
scan codes in).

To use the translation table simply put a /X: on the doorway command line
(before the /P: if there is one).  DOORWAY will then load DOORWAY.XLT from
the current directory.  If you want it to load a different table or from a
different directory then follow the /X: with the path\filename of the table.
You can rename the DOORWAY.XLT file, but it will have to be named DOORWAY.XLT
if you want to make modifications to it.

INTERNALS

The table consists of two tables of 256 words each.  Each word contains the
character code and scan code for each possible ASCII character.  The first
table is the lookup table for standard ASCII characters, and the second is for
extended codes.  For instance, if a ^C (ASCII 3) comes in the modem, the entry
at location 6 will be used to determine the translation.  Location 6 will be
passed to the program in the AL register (as the character) and location 7 will
be passed to the program as the scan code.  If an extended key was entered with
a scan code of 3 then the second table would be used, starting with offset 512
of the file.

If it is a HOY key, then the scan code byte will have a $F#, where the #
defines which keys are depressed.  The caracter byte will contain either the
character, if one was entered, or the scan code if it was not.
