DWXFER allows you to send and receive files from a drop to dos easily.
On the Host end, DWXFER.EXE must be in the path.  To start a transfer,
enter DWXFER REMOTE on the remote end, while the host is in DOS.  DWXFER
will then load DWXFER on the HOST side.  Using the cursor keys, insert,
and delete, fill in the fields for the filename to transfer, and the
paths (if required) on the host and remote end.  Then select the direction
with a ALT D.  To start the transfer, enter a ALT S.  DWXFER will not
overwrite an existing file without asking if it is ok to do so.

To abort a transfer enter ^K's.  To terminate a session enter ESC. If you
manage to get the ends out of sync, enter ^K's or if you have returned
to the terminal program and the HOST is still in DWXFER enter ^K's and ESC's.

If you are running com2 then you will need to use DWXFER REMOTE 2 to
bring up the program.

The simplest way to set this up is to put DWXFER into the directory your
com program is in.  Then set up an external protocol which simply does a
DWXFER REMOTE in the batch file.  Then to transfer data in DOS simply
shell the protocol.

This version has a bug fixed where it would report a "filename not same"
error.  If this occurs, then it means that the filename on the host and
remote ends are not the same, possibly line noise ended up on one end or
the other.  If this happens, delete the filename with the backspace or del
key, and continue deleting after the filename is gone for several more
times, to make sure any garbage on the other end is gone.  This should not
ever happen, as there is error checking between the two.
