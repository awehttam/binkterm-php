This is the DOORWAY drop to DOS.  I will need to know if your com program
on the remote end has 24 lines (with a status line) or 25 lines.  If you
can turn off the status line, then do so and select #2, otherwise select
#1.  For full functionality, turn on the DOORWAY mode in your com program
now.  For most com programs this is done by entering an ALT =.

1.  DROP TO DOS WITH A STATUS LINE ON REMOTE

2.  DROP TO DOS WITHOUT A STATUS LINE ON REMOTE

3.  RETURN TO THE HOST AND DISCONNECT

M:Please enter 1, 2 or 3:
