Admin Doorway

This door provides a drop to shell function and relies on the Doorway serial redirector.

An unregistered version is included as "DOORWAYU.EXE" and offers a ten minute maximum session 
length limitation.  If you have a registered version, simply drop in the DOORWAY.EXE as DOORWAY.EXE andn
the start.bat launch script will use your version instead of DOORWAYU.EXE

Technically registration can be done through http://pcmicro.com/doorway/order/ but it is uncertain whether registration
is available at this time.

This door is handled specially by BinktermPHP and was implemented to only load for admin users.
