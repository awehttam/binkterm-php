## Summary of Changes

### Messaging

- **Date display preferences:** users and sysops can now choose between relative timestamps ("4d ago") and exact date/time for message lists and headers, and choose whether echomail is ordered and displayed by received date or written date.
- **Message search scoped by network:** searching for messages from the Echo Areas page now respects the network filter selected there, instead of always searching every echo area.

## Messaging

### Date Display Preferences

Two new preferences control how dates are shown across echo area listings, echomail message headers, and netmail lists:

- **Date display style** — choose relative time (e.g. "4d ago", "2h ago") or exact date and time, formatted using the user's selected date format locale and timezone.
- **Echomail date field** — choose whether echomail lists and ordering use the received date (when the message arrived on this system) or the written date (when the original author composed it).

Both preferences default to "System Default," which follows a BBS-wide default that sysops can set in **Admin -> BBS Settings -> Features**. Users can override the system default for either preference individually in **Settings -> Preferences**.

Previously, only admin users could choose to order echomail by written date; this option is now available to all users. If your installation currently sets `ECHOMAIL_ORDER_DATE=written`, non-admin users will now see that ordering apply to them as well, following the same fallback chain (user preference, then BBS default, then this environment variable).

### Message Search Scoped by Network

The Echo Areas page lets you filter the area list down to one or more networks using the **Network** dropdown. The "Search Messages" box on that same page now carries that network selection into the search, so results are limited to echo areas in the selected network(s) instead of every echo area on the system. Selecting "All Networks" (the default) still searches everything, and searching from a specific echo area on the Echomail page continues to scope to that single area as before.
