## Summary of Changes

### Messaging

- **Date display preferences:** users and sysops can now choose between relative timestamps ("4d ago") and exact date/time for message lists and headers, and choose whether echomail is ordered and displayed by received date or written date.

## Messaging

### Date Display Preferences

Two new preferences control how dates are shown across echo area listings, echomail message headers, and netmail lists:

- **Date display style** — choose relative time (e.g. "4d ago", "2h ago") or exact date and time, formatted using the user's selected date format locale and timezone.
- **Echomail date field** — choose whether echomail lists and ordering use the received date (when the message arrived on this system) or the written date (when the original author composed it).

Both preferences default to "System Default," which follows a BBS-wide default that sysops can set in **Admin -> BBS Settings -> Features**. Users can override the system default for either preference individually in **Settings -> Preferences**.

Previously, only admin users could choose to order echomail by written date; this option is now available to all users. If your installation currently sets `ECHOMAIL_ORDER_DATE=written`, non-admin users will now see that ordering apply to them as well, following the same fallback chain (user preference, then BBS default, then this environment variable).
