## Summary of Changes

### Message Composition

- The compose editor's automatic line-wrap column now defaults to **72** instead of 79, and 72 is offered as the recommended choice in the compose Advanced Options. Wrapping at 72 leaves room for quote-attribution prefixes (for example ` AB> `) so that quoted reply lines stay within the 79-column width that FidoNet readers expect. The 79-column option is still available for users who prefer it, and anyone who has already chosen a wrap width keeps their setting.

## Message Composition

When composing netmail or echomail, the editor can hard-wrap long lines automatically as you type. The wrap column is a per-user preference in the compose form's **Advanced Options**.

Previously the default was 79 columns. When replying to a message, each quoted line is prefixed with an attribution string such as ` AB> `, which pushed quoted lines past 79 columns and caused readers to wrap them a second time. The default is now 72 columns, which keeps quoted lines within 79 after the prefix is added. A new **72 characters (recommended)** option appears in the wrap selector; the **79** option remains for users who want it. Existing saved preferences are unchanged.
