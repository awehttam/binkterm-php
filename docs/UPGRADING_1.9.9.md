## Summary of Changes

### Core Platform

- **Admin -> Users** now includes an **Approved Registration History** lookup inside the registrations panel. Pending registrations and retained approved-registration history now share one tabbed panel, making it easier to review current signup requests and look up previously approved accounts without taking extra vertical space on the page.
- When **Require approval for new users** is disabled, successful self-registrations now create an authenticated session immediately. Web users are signed in right away, and Telnet/SSH users continue directly into the terminal session without reconnecting.

## Core Platform

### Registration Lookup in Admin Users

The **Admin -> Users** page now combines registration review into a single tabbed panel:

- **Pending Registrations** remains the place to approve or reject new signups
- **Approved Registration History** is a new searchable lookup for retained approved-registration records

The approved-history lookup searches existing retained registration records by:

- requested username
- real name
- email address
- created account username

When you open a registration record, the detail view now also shows review metadata already stored on the record, including:

- review timestamp
- reviewing admin
- admin notes

This change builds on the retained registration-history behavior introduced in the 1.9.x series. It does not add a schema change or require any extra upgrade step beyond the normal file update.

### Automatic Login After Auto-Approved Registration

If **Admin -> BBS Settings -> Features -> Require approval for new users** is disabled, successful self-registration now logs the new account in immediately instead of leaving the user at a manual login step.

- On the web interface, the registration flow now creates the normal authenticated session and redirects the new user into the site.
- On the terminal services, the Telnet/SSH registration flow now continues directly into the authenticated BBS session instead of disconnecting after registration.

This is a behavior change only. It does not add a schema change or require any extra upgrade step beyond the normal file update.
