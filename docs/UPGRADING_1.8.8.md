## Summary of Changes

**File Areas & TIC Processing**
- Incoming TIC ZIP processing now uses `FILE_ID.DIZ` only from the archive root.
- If the ZIP has no root-level `FILE_ID.DIZ`, the processor will use `/directory/FILE_ID.DIZ` only when that single directory is the only directory at the archive root.
- `FILE_ID.DIZ` files nested deeper than one level are now ignored.
- This prevents the wrong long description from being pulled from deeply nested packaging layouts.

## File Areas & TIC Processing

### FILE_ID.DIZ Selection for Incoming TIC ZIPs

BinktermPHP can use `FILE_ID.DIZ` inside an incoming TIC ZIP to fill in missing
`Desc` and `LDesc` values when the TIC metadata does not provide them.

In earlier 1.8.x builds, the TIC incoming processor matched `FILE_ID.DIZ` by
basename only. That meant a ZIP containing multiple copies of `FILE_ID.DIZ`
could use the wrong one, including files nested deeper inside subdirectories.

Version 1.8.8 tightens that lookup logic:

- Prefer `/FILE_ID.DIZ` at the ZIP root.
- If no root-level `FILE_ID.DIZ` exists, allow `/directory/FILE_ID.DIZ` only
  when that single directory is the only directory at the archive root.
- Never descend more than one directory level when selecting `FILE_ID.DIZ` for
  TIC description import.

This change improves compatibility with common single-top-level-directory ZIP
layouts while avoiding incorrect descriptions from nested archive content.

## Upgrade Instructions

This release does not add database migrations or new required configuration for
this fix. A normal application upgrade is sufficient.

### From Git

1. Pull the latest code: `git pull`
2. Run setup: `php scripts/setup.php`
3. Restart the daemons if they are running: `bash scripts/restart_daemons.sh`

### Using the Installer

Re-run the BinktermPHP installer to upgrade the application files, then restart
the daemons if your deployment manages them separately.
