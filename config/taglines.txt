Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes
FidoNet: the original social network
640K ought to be enough for anybody
The packets are flowing and nobody knows why
ANSI is not dead, it just blinks slowly
Echomail: where words travel farther than you do
Real sysops read logs for fun
The boxes are talking to each other again
One node down, thousands to go
Keeping the net alive, one packet at a time
