 * Test the restructured address book with separate name and messaging_user_id fields

echo "Testing Restructured Address Book\n";
echo "=================================\n\n";

echo "=== NEW ADDRESS BOOK STRUCTURE ===\n";
echo "The address book now has:\n";
echo "• name: Descriptive name (e.g., 'John Smith', 'Work colleague')\n";
echo "• messaging_user_id: User ID for sending messages (e.g., 'jsmith', 'aug')\n";
echo "• node_address: FidoNet address (e.g., '2:460/256')\n\n";

echo "=== EXAMPLE SCENARIOS ===\n\n";

// Test Case 1: REPLYTO message save
echo "1. Saving from REPLYTO Message\n";
echo "------------------------------\n";
echo "Message from: Aug (2:460/256)\n";
echo "REPLYTO kludge: 1223717052 (2:460/256)\n";
echo "\n";
echo "Address book entry will be:\n";
echo "• Name: 'Aug' (descriptive - original sender)\n";
echo "• User ID: '1223717052' (for messaging - from REPLYTO)\n";
echo "• Node Address: '2:460/256'\n";
echo "• Description: 'Added from netmail message. Original sender: Aug (2:460/256), Reply-to: 1223717052 (2:460/256)'\n";
echo "\n";
echo "When user clicks this contact to compose a message:\n";
echo "→ To field will be populated with '1223717052' (the messaging user ID)\n";
echo "→ Address will be '2:460/256'\n";
echo "✓ This ensures messages go to the REPLYTO address\n\n";

// Test Case 2: Regular message save
echo "2. Saving from Regular Message\n";
echo "------------------------------\n";
echo "Message from: TestUser (1:123/456)\n";
echo "No REPLYTO kludge\n";
echo "\n";
echo "Address book entry will be:\n";
echo "• Name: 'TestUser' (descriptive)\n";
echo "• User ID: 'TestUser' (for messaging)\n";
echo "• Node Address: '1:123/456'\n";
echo "• Description: 'Added from netmail message. Sender: TestUser (1:123/456)'\n";
echo "\n";
echo "When user clicks this contact to compose a message:\n";
echo "→ To field will be populated with 'TestUser'\n";
echo "→ Address will be '1:123/456'\n";
echo "✓ Standard messaging to the original sender\n\n";

// Test Case 3: Manual entry
echo "3. Manual Address Book Entry\n";
echo "----------------------------\n";
echo "User manually adds:\n";
echo "• Name: 'John Smith - My Brother'\n";
echo "• User ID: 'jsmith'\n";
echo "• Node Address: '1:234/567'\n";
echo "\n";
echo "Address book display will show:\n";
echo "┌─────────────────────────────┐\n";
echo "│ John Smith - My Brother     │\n";
echo "│ @jsmith                     │\n";
echo "│ 1:234/567                   │\n";
echo "└─────────────────────────────┘\n";
echo "\n";
echo "When user clicks this contact to compose a message:\n";
echo "→ To field will be populated with 'jsmith'\n";
echo "→ Address will be '1:234/567'\n";
echo "✓ Clean separation of display name and messaging target\n\n";

echo "=== TECHNICAL CHANGES ===\n";
echo "✓ Database migration: Renamed full_name → name, added messaging_user_id\n";
echo "✓ AddressBookController: Updated all CRUD operations\n";
echo "✓ Frontend forms: Added User ID field alongside Name field\n";
echo "✓ Address book display: Shows both name and @user_id\n";
echo "✓ Compose integration: Uses messaging_user_id for message targeting\n";
echo "✓ Save functions: Intelligently populates both fields based on message type\n\n";

echo "=== BENEFITS ===\n";
echo "• Users can have descriptive names while maintaining clean messaging targets\n";
echo "• REPLYTO functionality works correctly with proper user ID routing\n";
echo "• Address book entries are more informative and organized\n";
echo "• Separation of concerns: display vs. messaging logic\n";
echo "• Better user experience for contact management\n\n";

echo "=== MIGRATION REQUIRED ===\n";
echo "To use this new structure, run:\n";
echo "database/migrations/v1.5.1_restructure_address_book.sql\n\n";

echo "This migration will:\n";
echo "1. Add messaging_user_id column\n";
echo "2. Rename full_name to name\n";
echo "3. Copy existing names to messaging_user_id (can be edited later)\n";
echo "4. Update indexes and constraints\n";
echo "5. Update column comments for documentation\n";
